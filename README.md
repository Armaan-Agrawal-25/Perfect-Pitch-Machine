**Perfect Pitch Machine:** Designed and developed a “Perfect Pitch Machine” application that takes in a sound from either a recording or a live instrument and displays the name of the note played and an image of the note highlighted on a keyboard. This was created in an effort to help novice pianists learn the names of the notes and have a sense of what each note sounds like.
- Wrote a Javascript program that changes the text and image based on the note classified by the machine learning model.
- Wrote HTML and CSS code to specify the look of the application.
- Created a machine learning model that is composed of different classes for each white key on a piano that classifies what it hears as a specific piano note.
